* Consistently release js.Func objects. Search for invocations of js.FuncOf().
* Implement a mutex around BigStorage to prevent cleaning up chunks that may be referenced.
  This is now possible since Delete() is no longer an atomic operation; it deletes keys,
  then cleans up dangling chunks. However, dangling chunks may be newly-referenced if
  Set() is invoked at the same time as Delete().  This is unlikely given that this is only
  done in the Options UI, but we should more systematically prevent this.
